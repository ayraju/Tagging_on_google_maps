In this application, we can display the places in google maps by tagging the places.


I have done this app by using the gems following,

 - Geocoder
   Geocoder is a complete geocoding solution for Ruby. With Rails it adds geocoding (by street or IP address), reverse geocoding (find street address based on given coordinates), and distance queries.

 - ActsAsTaggableOn
   Enter Acts as Taggable On.
   we can tags the places like persons skills and sports in the social networks. 
   
  Along with that placed good interface like bootstrap.
